Indigo Banking System (IBS)
---
Indigo is a small and simple ATM machine written in Python that allows you to execute functions such as:

- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Transfer
- Check Balance
- Register New Account
- Logout

---

After you press register - the ATM Machine will create a new account and print out the login details.

---

An IBS account consists of:

- Account Number (10 digit username)
- PIN (4 digit password)
- Balance (Set to $0.00 at default)

All account data is stored in folders named after their Account Numbers and inside, there are files which
contain the PIN and Balance. You can find these folders in the /database catalog.
